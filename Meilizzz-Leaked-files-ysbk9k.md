Since her breakthrough exhibition, Meilizzz has collaborated with several high-profile artists and organizations. In 2017, she worked with the British fashion brand Burberry to create a series of limited-edition scarves inspired by her artwork.

Meilizzz has also received several awards for her work, including the Young Artist of the Year Award from the British Art Awards in 2016. Meilizzz's music is characterized by her soaring vocals, introspective lyrics, and eclectic blend of pop, rock, and electronic elements. Her songs often explore themes of love, relationships, and self-discovery, with a focus on storytelling and emotional authenticity. Meilizzz's influences range from classic rock and pop to electronic and indie music, and she has cited artists such as Radiohead, Björk, and St. Vincent as key inspirations.
